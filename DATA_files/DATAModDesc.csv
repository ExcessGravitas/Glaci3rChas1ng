101,"You will spend two hours per week in lectures studying topics including the synthesis, bonding and reactivity of organometallic compounds, the use of symmetry and group theory to interpret infra-red spectra and NMR spectroscopy in inorganic chemistry. Further support is provided by tutorials every third week."
102,"You will learn about Natures building blocks including the structure and functions of lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates and nucleotides. You will also learn about the reactivity of these molecules and their biological roles through case studies."
103,"This module will develop your knowledge and understanding of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, catalyst promotion and the concept of catalytic cycles. You will attend two lectures per week in this module."
201,"The module introduces basic principles of programming and algorithms. It covers fundamental programming constructs, such as types and variables, expressions, control structures, and functions. You will learn how to design and analyse simple algorithms and data structures that allow efficient storage and manipulation of data. You will also become familiar with basic software development methodology. You will spend around six hours per week in lectures, computer classes and tutorials."
202,"You will gain a basic understanding of the fundamental architecture of computers and computer networks. You will learn how the simple building blocks of digital logic can be put together in different ways to build an entire computer. You will also learn how modern computer systems and networks are constructed of hierarchical layers of functionality which build on and abstract the layers below. You will spend five hours per week in tutorials, lectures and computer classes."
203,"This module considers both the structure of databases, including how to make them fast, efficient and reliable, and the appropriate user interfaces which will make them easy to interact with for users. You will start by looking at how to design a database, gaining an understanding of the standard features that management systems provide and how you can best utilise them, then develop an interactive application to access your database."
301,"You will begin by practising the basic concepts and methods of calculus including limits, functions, and continuity. In the second semester you will move onto more advanced usage of calculus. Topics will be based around the calculus of functions of several variables and include partial derivatives, chain rules, the vector operator grad, Lagrange multipliers and multiple integrals."
302,This module provides an introduction to probability by developing a framework for the logic of uncertainty. Random variables and the topics surrounding them will also be introduced.
303,You will learn about the theory and applications of functions of a complex variable using a method and applications approach. You will develop an understanding of the theory of complex functions and evaluate certain real integrals using your new skills.
401,An introductory module covering analysis methods applicable to engineering design.
402,"This module aims to introduce students to methodologies for materials selection and process selection for design improvement. This module seeks to develop an understanding of the role of materials in the design of a range of components, from consumer goods to large scale structures."
403,This is an introductory module covering the fundamental concepts and principles of thermofluids and their applications to engineering problems.
501,"In this module, you are introduced to the concepts of scalar and vector fields, and introduced to the mathematics of vector calculus that can be used to describe these fields. The mathematics will then be used to provide a framework for describing, understanding and using the laws of electromagnetism."
502,"Many physical systems support the propagation of waves, from the familiar waves on the surface of water to the electromagnetic waves that we perceive as light. The first half of the module will focus on optics: the study of light. Topics to be covered will include: geometrical optics; wave description of light; interference and diffraction; optical interferometry. The second half of the module will introduce more general methods for the discussion of wave propagation, and Fourier methods."
503,This module will develop your knowledge of the various physical processes occurring in stars of different types. You will use this knowledge to build both mathematical models and your qualitative physical understanding of stellar structure and evolution will be enhanced. You will have two hours per week of lectures studying this module.
